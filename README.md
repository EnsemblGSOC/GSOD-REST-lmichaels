# Google Season of Docs 2019 - Laurel Michaels

## Short Description of Work Done

I created introductory, getting started documentation for people wanting to access Ensembl data via the REST API.

Although Ensemblâ€™s documentation included extensive reference information for the Ensembl REST API, the doc lacked a comprehensive, user-friendly getting started section for anybody who is new to the REST API. The doc I created during the GSoD project provides this needed getting started section.

To start, the new getting started doc introduces the Ensembl REST API capabilities, then moves on to quick hands-on tutorials and Ensembl-specific URL information and examples. It concludes with scripting shortcuts and tips for Python, Perl, and R scripts.

## Documentation That Ensembl Merged into its Repository

The project documentation is located [here](https://github.com/EnsemblGSOC/GSOD-REST-lmichaels/wiki).

## State of the Project

Complete

## Challenges and Learnings

It was great to get feedback from Ensembl team members who interact directly with REST API users.

It was both fun and interesting to learn about the Ensembl REST API implementation as well as to learn about what people who use the REST API need to get started.
